## Overview

**Location:** [[Springdoor#The Cemetery (Cemetery)]]
**Faction:** #NPC
**Occupation:**
**Status:** #Alive

## Possessions:

300 gp, a collection of preserved flowers, a weather-worn shovel with mysterious runes, a black cat familiar named Shadow, various embalming tools

## Description:

A gaunt, hunched figure with pale skin that rarely sees sunlight. His long, greasy black hair falls over his face, partially obscuring his mismatched eyes - one normal brown, the other an unsettling milky white that seems to glow in the dark. He wears tattered black clothing that's always slightly too large for his frame, and his movements are quick and furtive. His hands are stained with dirt and various preserving chemicals, and he always carries his trusty shovel.

## Personality:

Despite his unsettling appearance, Mortimer is actually quite gentle and respectful of the dead. He's deeply superstitious and follows ancient burial traditions to the letter. While he's not particularly social, he takes his duties seriously and maintains the cemetery with meticulous care. He's known to talk to the graves as he works, treating each one as if the occupant were still present.

## History:

Born with his unusual eye condition, Mortimer was shunned by his village and found solace in the company of the dead. He learned the art of gravekeeping from an old mentor who took him in. After his mentor's passing, he wandered from town to town before finding a permanent home in Springdoor's cemetery, where his skills are appreciated despite his appearance.

## Motivation:

To ensure the dead rest peacefully and their final resting places are maintained with dignity and respect, regardless of how the living view him.

## Rumor:

Some say that Mortimer's mismatched eyes allow him to see both the living and the dead, explaining why he's so good at his job. Others whisper that his black cat, Shadow, is actually a guardian spirit that helps him keep the restless dead at peace.
