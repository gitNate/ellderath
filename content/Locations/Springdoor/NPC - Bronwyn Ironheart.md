## Description:

A stocky dwarf woman with arms like tree trunks and hands covered in calluses. Her auburn hair is usually tied back in a practical braid, though wisps often escape to frame her face. Her eyes are a striking emerald green, and her skin is tanned from years of working near the forge. She wears a heavy leather apron covered in soot and burn marks.

## Personality:

Direct and no-nonsense, Bronwyn takes great pride in her craft. She's known for her dry sense of humor and her willingness to share her knowledge with those who show genuine interest. While she can be gruff, she's fair in her dealings and has a soft spot for young apprentices.
