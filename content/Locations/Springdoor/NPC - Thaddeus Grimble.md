## Description:

A stout halfling with a perpetual smile and twinkling eyes. His curly brown hair is always neatly combed, and he wears practical but well-maintained clothing. Despite his small stature, he carries himself with an air of quiet confidence. His most distinctive feature is a small scar above his right eyebrow, which he claims he got from a "misunderstanding with a particularly aggressive cabbage."

## Personality:

Friendly and approachable, Thaddeus has a knack for remembering customers' names and preferences. He's honest to a fault and takes great pride in the quality of his merchandise. While generally cheerful, he can be surprisingly shrewd when it comes to business dealings.

## History:

Born to a family of traveling merchants, Thaddeus learned the value of a good deal and the importance of customer service from an early age. After years of traveling with his family's caravan, he decided to settle down in Springdoor and open his own general store. The One Eyed Basilisk has been his pride and joy for the past decade.

## Motivation:

To provide the best service and goods to his community while maintaining a fair and honest business.

## Rumor:

Some say that Thaddeus's lucky copper piece is actually a magical artifact that helps him make the best business decisions. Others whisper that he's secretly a member of a powerful merchant's guild that spans multiple kingdoms, explaining his ability to acquire rare and exotic goods.
