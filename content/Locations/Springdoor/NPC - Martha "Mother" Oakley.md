## Description:

A plump, motherly woman in her late fifties with silver-streaked brown hair usually tied up in a practical bun. Her warm brown eyes seem to miss nothing, and her hands are always busy - either cooking, cleaning, or gesturing while telling stories. She wears simple but well-made clothing, always with a clean white apron tied around her waist. Her laugh is infectious and can be heard throughout the inn.

## Personality:

Warm and welcoming, Martha treats every guest like family. She's known for her sharp wit and even sharper tongue when dealing with troublemakers. Despite her kind nature, she's no pushover and can handle rowdy patrons with surprising efficiency. She takes great pride in her cooking and the comfort of her guests.

## History:

Born in a small farming village, Martha learned to cook from her grandmother, who was renowned for her culinary skills. After her husband passed away, she moved to Springdoor and purchased the inn, transforming it from a run-down establishment into one of the most welcoming places in town. Over the years, she's become a beloved figure in the community, known for her generosity and wisdom.

## Motivation:

To create a safe, welcoming home away from home for travelers and to maintain the inn's reputation as the best place to stay in Springdoor.

## Rumor:

Some say that Martha's famous pies are made with a secret ingredient that she harvests from a magical garden hidden behind the inn. Others whisper that the garden is actually a portal to the Feywild, explaining why her cooking has such an otherworldly quality to it.
