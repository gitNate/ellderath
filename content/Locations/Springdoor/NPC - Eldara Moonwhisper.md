## Description:

A tall, graceful elf with silver-white hair that seems to shimmer with its own light. Her eyes are an unusual violet color, and her movements are fluid and precise. She wears flowing robes in shades of blue and silver, adorned with subtle magical symbols that occasionally glow. Her hands are always moving, either casting minor cantrips or organizing her wares. A small white owl often perches on her shoulder, watching customers with intelligent eyes.

## Personality:

Eccentric but kind, Eldara has a childlike wonder about magic that's infectious. She's known for her dramatic flair when demonstrating magical items and her tendency to get lost in magical theory. Despite her sometimes scattered nature, she's incredibly knowledgeable about the arcane and takes great care in ensuring her customers understand the items they purchase.

## History:

Born in a high elven city, Eldara showed an early talent for magic but was more interested in the practical applications of the arcane than pure research. After completing her magical education, she traveled extensively, collecting magical items and knowledge. She settled in Springdoor after discovering a minor ley line intersection beneath the town, which she uses to power some of her more delicate magical experiments.

## Motivation:

To share the wonders of magic with others while ensuring magical items are used responsibly and safely.

## Rumor:

Some say that Eldara's white owl familiar, Snow, is actually a transformed archmage who watches over her. Others whisper that the shop's floating shelves are powered by the trapped souls of failed apprentices, though this is likely just a story to keep curious children away from the more dangerous items.
