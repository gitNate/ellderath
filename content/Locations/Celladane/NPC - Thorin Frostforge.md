## Description:

Thorin Frostforge is a burly dwarf in his late years with arms like tree trunks and hands that have shaped countless weapons and armor. His dark beard is streaked with silver and often contains small metal shavings from his work. His deep-set eyes burn with the intensity of his forge, and his weathered face bears the marks of decades spent working with fire and metal. He wears a heavy leather apron that's seen countless projects, and his clothing is practical but well-made. When he speaks, his voice carries the weight of authority that comes from being a master of his craft.

## Personality:

Thorin is the embodiment of dwarven craftsmanship - proud, exacting, and utterly dedicated to his art. He has little patience for shoddy work or those who don't respect the craft, but he's generous with his knowledge when teaching those who show genuine interest. He's deeply connected to the mining community, often working directly with [[NPC - Grim Ironbeard]] to source the finest materials. Thorin is also a bit of a perfectionist, sometimes spending weeks on a single piece to ensure it meets his exacting standards. He has a gruff exterior but takes great pride in seeing his creations protect and serve their owners.

## History:

Thorin was born in the dwarven stronghold of [[Knifepoint Peaks]], where he apprenticed under his father, a legendary smith known for creating weapons that could withstand the harshest conditions. He spent thirty years mastering his craft, learning not just the techniques of smithing, but also the magical properties of the rare metals and gems found in the mountains. When he came of age, Thorin traveled throughout [[Ellderath]], studying different smithing traditions and gathering knowledge. He eventually settled in [[Celladane]] and established the [[Celladane#Frostforge Foundry|Frostforge Foundry]], which has become renowned for creating weapons and armor of exceptional quality. His work is highly sought after by adventurers, soldiers, and collectors throughout the region.

## Motivation:

Thorin is driven by an unrelenting pursuit of perfection in his craft. He believes that every weapon and piece of armor he creates could mean the difference between life and death for its wielder, so he refuses to compromise on quality. He's also motivated by the challenge of working with the rare materials found in the local mines, constantly experimenting with new techniques to unlock their full potential. Thorin wants to ensure that [[Celladane]]'s reputation for quality craftsmanship continues to grow, and he takes great pride in training the next generation of smiths.

## Plot Hooks:

- [[Quest - The Dwarven Forge]] - Thorin needs help securing rare materials from dangerous mountain locations for a special project
- [[Quest - The Enchanted Blade]] - A weapon Thorin created has developed unexpected magical properties

## Rumor:

"Thorin's forge is said to be blessed by the spirits of ancient dwarven smiths - that's why his weapons never break and his armor can turn aside any blow."
