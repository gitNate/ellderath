## Description:

Grimm Ironbeard is a stout dwarf in his early sixties with a thick, well-groomed beard that's more iron-gray than the black it once was. His weathered face bears the marks of a life spent in harsh conditions, with deep laugh lines around his bright blue eyes. His hands are calloused from years of handling tools and equipment, and he moves with the deliberate confidence of someone who knows his craft inside and out. He wears practical clothing in dark earth tones, with a leather apron that's seen countless transactions, and always has a small notebook and pencil tucked behind his ear.

## Personality:

Grimm is the backbone of [[Celladane]]'s mining economy - practical, honest, and incredibly knowledgeable about his trade. He has a gruff exterior that hides a heart of gold, especially when it comes to helping miners get the equipment they need to work safely. He's a shrewd businessman but never takes advantage of his customers, believing that fair deals build lasting relationships. Grimm is also a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to his inventory, insisting on quality equipment that won't fail when lives depend on it.

## History:

Grimm was born in the dwarven stronghold of [[Knifepoint Peaks]], where he learned the value of quality equipment from his father, a master smith. He spent his early years working in the family forge, but his true calling was in trade and commerce. When he came of age, Grimm traveled throughout [[Ellderath]], learning about different mining techniques and equipment needs. He eventually settled in [[Celladane]] and opened [[Celladane#Mountain Supply Co.|Mountain Supply Co.]], which has become the go-to source for mining equipment in the region. His shop has supplied everything from basic picks to complex safety equipment for over 100 years.

## Motivation:

Grimm is driven by a deep respect for the mining profession and a desire to ensure that every miner has access to quality, safe equipment. He believes that proper tools and safety gear are essential for both productivity and survival in the dangerous mining environment. He's also motivated by the challenge of running a successful business while maintaining his reputation for honesty and quality. Grimm wants to see [[Celladane]]'s mining industry thrive and believes that starts with well-equipped miners.

## Plot Hooks:

- [[Quest - The Miner's Curse]] - Grimm's equipment is being blamed for the mysterious illness affecting miners
- [[Quest - The Frostpeak Expedition]] - Grimm needs help securing rare materials from dangerous mountain locations

## Rumor:

"Grimm keeps a secret vault beneath his shop where he stores the finest gems and metals from the mines - some say he's the richest dwarf in [[Celladane]] but you'd never know it from his simple lifestyle."
