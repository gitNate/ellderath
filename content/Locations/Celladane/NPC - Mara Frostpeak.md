## Description:

Mara Frostpeak is a robust woman in her late forties with a warm, weathered face that speaks of years spent in the mountain climate. Her dark hair is streaked with gray and usually tied back in a practical braid. She has strong, capable hands from years of hard work, and her eyes are bright and welcoming. Mara wears simple but well-made woolen clothing in warm earth tones, with a clean apron that's always ready for work. Her movements are efficient and practiced, honed by decades of running the lodge.

## Personality:

Mara is the soul of hospitality in [[Celladane]] - warm, practical, and endlessly patient. She has a motherly nature that makes travelers feel at home, but also a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to running her establishment. She's deeply knowledgeable about the local area and its people, and takes great pride in her lodge's reputation for warmth and comfort.

## History:

Mara was born in [[Celladane]] to a family of miners, but showed an early talent for hospitality and organization. She apprenticed under the previous lodge owner, **Old Man Thorne**, for five years before taking over the [[Celladane#Frostpeak Lodge|Frostpeak Lodge]] when he retired. She's been running the lodge for over fifteen years, and has seen everything from minor travelers to important merchants and even the occasional adventurer. Her lodge has become a community hub as much as a place to stay.

## Motivation:

Mara is driven by a deep desire to provide comfort and safety to travelers in the harsh mountain environment. She sees her role as not just providing lodging, but creating a home away from home for anyone who needs it. She's particularly concerned about the safety of travelers during winter storms and has developed several protocols for emergency situations. She also wants to help build connections between the mining community and the outside world.

## Plot Hooks:

- [[Quest - The Frozen Traveler]] - A guest has been found frozen to death in their room, despite the lodge being warm

## Rumor:

"Mara keeps a secret room in the lodge basement where she stores supplies for the worst winter storms - some say she's saved dozens of lives during blizzards."
