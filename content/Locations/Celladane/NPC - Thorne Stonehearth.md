## Description:

Thorne Stonehearth is a sturdy woman in her early fifties with weathered hands and kind, crinkled eyes that speak of years spent both in the harsh mountain climate and tending to the needs of her community. Her auburn hair is streaked with silver and usually braided back from her face. She wears practical woolen clothing in earthy tones, with a leather apron that's seen countless remedies prepared. Her movements are deliberate and practiced, honed by decades of herbalism work.

## Personality:

Thorne is the heart of [[Celladane]]'s community - warm, practical, and unflappable. She has a motherly nature that puts patients at ease, but also a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to safety and proper treatment. She's deeply knowledgeable about mountain herbs and their properties, and takes great pride in her work. Thorne is also a bit of a gossip, but always in a caring way - she genuinely wants to know how everyone is doing.

## History:

Thorne was born in [[Celladane]] to a family of miners, but showed an early aptitude for healing and herbalism. She apprenticed under the town's previous herbalist, Old Man Frost, for ten years before taking over the shop when he passed. She's been the town's primary healer for over twenty years, and has treated everything from minor scrapes to serious mining accidents. Her shop, **Stonehearth Remedies**, has become a community gathering place as much as a medical facility.

## Motivation:

Thorne is driven by a deep desire to keep her community healthy and safe. She sees her role as not just treating injuries, but preventing them through education and proper preparation. She's particularly concerned about the miners' safety and has developed several specialized remedies for common mining ailments. She also wants to pass on her knowledge to the next generation.

## Plot Hooks:

- [[Quest - The Missing Herbs]] - Someone has been stealing rare mountain herbs from Thorne's garden
- [[Quest - The Miner's Curse]] - Miners are falling ill with an unknown condition that Thorne's usual remedies can't treat
- [[Quest - The Frostpeak Expedition]] - Thorne needs help gathering rare herbs from the dangerous high peaks

## Rumor:

"Thorne keeps a secret stash of healing potions made from the tears of Auril herself - that's why her remedies work so well in the winter."
