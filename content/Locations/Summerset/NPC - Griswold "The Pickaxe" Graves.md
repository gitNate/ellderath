## Description:

A gaunt, hunched figure with pale skin that rarely sees sunlight. His long, greasy black hair falls over his face, partially obscuring his mismatched eyes - one normal brown, the other an unsettling milky white that seems to glow in the dark. He wears tattered black clothing that's always slightly too large for his frame, and his movements are quick and furtive. His hands are stained with dirt and various preserving chemicals, and he always carries his trusty pickaxe, which earned him his nickname. Despite his intimidating appearance, there's a gentle wisdom in his eyes.

## Personality:

- Meticulous and organized
- Deeply spiritual
- Suspicious of outsiders
- Protective of the church's secrets
- Knowledgeable about local history
- Gentle and respectful of the dead
- Deeply superstitious
- Takes his duties seriously

## History:

Griswold has been the caretaker of the Old Church for 20 years, taking the position after a life of mining. Born with his unusual eye condition, he was shunned by his village and found solace in the company of the dead. He learned the art of gravekeeping from an old mentor who took him in. After his mentor's passing, he wandered from town to town before finding a permanent home in Summerset's Old Church, where his skills are appreciated despite his appearance. He's known for his extensive knowledge of the church's history and the catacombs beneath it.

## Motivation:

To ensure the dead rest peacefully and their final resting places are maintained with dignity and respect, regardless of how the living view him.

## Rumor:

Some say that Griswold's mismatched eyes allow him to see both the living and the dead, explaining why he's so good at his job. Others whisper that his black cat, Shadow, is actually a guardian spirit that helps him keep the restless dead at peace.
