# Quest: Whispers in the Wind

## Hook

The party is approached by [[Mayor Thaddeus Sterling]] of Summerset, who is concerned about a series of strange occurrences in his town. People have been reporting hearing whispers in the wind, experiencing vivid nightmares, and some have even gone missing. The mayor offers 100 gold pieces to investigate these disturbances.

## Setting
