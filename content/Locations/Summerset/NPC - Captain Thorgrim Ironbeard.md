## Description:

A stout, broad-shouldered Mountain Dwarf in his early 150s (middle-aged for a dwarf) with a meticulously braided beard of iron-gray hair, interwoven with silver rings and clan tokens. His weathered face bears the scars of past battles, and his deep-set eyes, the color of polished steel, miss nothing. His uniform, though tailored for a dwarf's stature, is immaculate, with polished silver buttons and a badge of office bearing the town's crest. Despite his shorter height, he commands respect through his confident bearing and the weight of his authority. His hands, though calloused from years of combat, are surprisingly nimble when handling documents or weapons.
