# Overview

[[Dimreed]] is a hardy, resourceful town that has adapted to its harsh surroundings with the [[Breaking Sea]] to its north and [[Illgadar Desert]] to its south. The buildings are constructed with sturdy stone and wood from the nearby mountains, designed to withstand both the scorching desert sun and the howling coastal winds. Life here is rugged, with a strong emphasis on community and mutual aid. The townâ€™s economy relies on a mix of fishing, mining in the [[Knifepoint Peaks]], and trade with passing merchants who brave the desert and sea routes.
