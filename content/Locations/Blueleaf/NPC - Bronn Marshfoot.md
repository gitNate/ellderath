## Description:

Bronn Marshfoot is an old dwarf whose weathered face tells tales of decades spent in the harsh marsh environment. His muscular frame, typical of his kind, is now slightly stooped with age. His most distinctive feature is his missing left ear, a permanent reminder of his encounter with a swamp troll. He dresses in practical innkeeper's attire - a simple tunic, leather apron, and sturdy boots, all well-worn but meticulously maintained. His remaining ear is often adorned with a small golden earring, a family heirloom from his mountain home.

## Personality:

Bronn is a no-nonsense dwarf who has adapted to the marsh's harsh environment by being direct and efficient. While not unkind, he has little patience for idle chatter or foolishness. His years in the marsh have taught him to be observant and cautious, making him an excellent judge of character. He's particularly protective of his tavern and its patrons, viewing them as an extension of his family. Despite his gruff exterior, he has a deep respect for those who show respect for the marsh and its dangers.

## History:

Bronn's story is one of adaptation and survival. Originally from a mountain stronghold, he came to Blueleaf seeking a new life after a mining accident claimed the lives of his family. His initial years in the marsh were difficult, but his dwarf resilience saw him through. The defining moment of his life in the marsh came when he encountered a swamp troll while checking his supply lines. The battle was fierce, and though he survived, he lost his left ear in the process. This experience taught him to respect the marsh's dangers and led him to take over the Marshlight Tavern, where he could protect others from similar fates.

## Motivation:

Bronn is driven by a deep sense of responsibility to his community and a desire to protect others from the marsh's dangers. He sees the tavern as more than just a business - it's a haven for those who need it and a place where he can keep an eye on the marsh's threats.

## Plot Hooks:

- [[Quest - The Swamp Troll Hunt]]: Bronn offers a substantial reward for the party to hunt down the troll that took his ear, providing them with detailed information about its last known location and behavior patterns.
- [[Marsh Supply Run]]: The tavern is running low on supplies, and Bronn needs trustworthy individuals to make a dangerous journey to a nearby settlement.
- Information Network: Bronn's position as an information broker could lead to various quests involving gathering intelligence about marsh activities or tracking down specific individuals.

## Rumor:

{To be added}

## Occupation:

As the keeper of the Marshlight Tavern, Bronn serves as both innkeeper and information broker. His establishment is built on a large platform above a warehouse, offering a safe haven for travelers and locals alike. He maintains a network of contacts throughout the marsh, gathering information about potential threats and opportunities. His role extends beyond serving drinks - he's a mediator in disputes, a source of marsh wisdom, and a protector of the community. His tavern is known for its hearty meals, strong drinks, and the reliable information that can be obtained there - for the right price.
