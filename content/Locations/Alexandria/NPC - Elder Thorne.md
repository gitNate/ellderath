## Description:

Elder Thorne is a wiry man in his late sixties, with weathered skin that tells stories of countless hours spent gathering herbs under the desert sun. His silver hair is kept in a long braid, and his piercing green eyes seem to miss nothing. His hands, though gnarled with age, move with surprising precision when handling delicate herbs and creating remedies. He wears a leather apron stained with various plant juices and carries a silver dagger at his belt for harvesting herbs.

## Personality:

Despite his gruff exterior, Elder Thorne is deeply passionate about his craft. He's known for his sharp tongue and no-nonsense attitude, often complaining about how "things were better in his day." However, beneath his cantankerous demeanor lies a wealth of knowledge and a genuine desire to help those in need. He's particularly protective of his rare desert herbs and has little patience for those who don't respect the delicate balance of nature. Like most Alexandrians, he's initially wary of outsiders but warms to those who show proper respect for his craft.

## Possessions:

- 150 gp
- Rare desert herbs collection
- Herbalism kit
- Weather-worn leather satchel
- Silver dagger (for harvesting herbs)
- Various potions and remedies
- A mysterious "never-withering leaf" (rumored)

## History:

Elder Thorne has spent over four decades studying the unique flora of the [[Illgadar Desert]] and the surrounding regions. He established The Withered Leaf fifty years ago, and it has become Alexandria's primary source of medicinal herbs and remedies. His knowledge of desert plants has saved countless lives during harsh sandstorms and helped treat injuries from the dangerous creatures that occasionally wander from [[The Giants Maw]]. He was one of the few who survived the great sandstorm of 1478 DR that nearly destroyed Alexandria, using his knowledge of desert survival to help others find shelter and water.

## Motivation:

Thorne is driven by two main goals: preserving the ancient knowledge of desert herbology and ensuring Alexandria's people have access to proper medical care. He's particularly concerned about the younger generation's lack of interest in traditional herbalism, preferring "new-fangled" magical solutions. He also feels a deep responsibility to protect Alexandria from the dangers of the desert, using his knowledge to help the town's defenders.

## Secrets:

### Public Knowledge:

- Thorne has been Alexandria's herbalist for over 40 years
- He's saved many lives with his desert herb remedies
- He's gruff but reliable when it comes to healing
- He trades with desert nomads for rare ingredients

### Hidden Secret:

- Thorne was once a member of a desert #druid circle before settling in Alexandria
- He has a hidden garden in the desert where he grows the rarest herbs
- He's been secretly teaching a few trusted apprentices the ancient druidic ways
- He knows the location of several hidden oases in the Illgadar Desert

### Deep Secret:

- Thorne's "never-withering leaf" is actually a fragment of an ancient desert spirit

## Rumor:

Some say Thorne can communicate with plants and that his shop's name comes from a magical leaf that never withers, hidden somewhere in his collection. Others whisper that he's actually much older than he appears, having discovered the secret of eternal life in the desert herbs.

## Occupation:

As the owner of The Withered Leaf, Thorne spends his days:

- Creating and selling remedies
- Teaching apprentices the art of herbalism
- Maintaining his extensive herb garden
- Trading with desert nomads for rare ingredients
- Providing medical advice to the townspeople
- Consulting with the Citadel of the Sun priests on healing matters
- Advising the town's defenders on desert survival techniques

## Relationships:

- **Citadel of the Sun Priests**: Respected colleagues in healing, though he sometimes disagrees with their magical approaches
- **Desert Nomads**: Trusted trading partners who bring him rare herbs from deep in the desert
- **Town Council**: Occasionally consulted on matters of public health and desert threats
- **Local Guards**: Provides them with healing potions and desert survival advice
- **Other Alexandria NPCs**: Generally respected but considered eccentric by some

## Current Situation:

- Concerned about increasing bandit activity in the desert
- Working on a new remedy for sandstorm-related illnesses
- Training a promising young apprentice named Kira
- Investigating reports of strange plant growth near The Giant's Maw
