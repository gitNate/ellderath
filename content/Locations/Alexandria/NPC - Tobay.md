## Description:

Tobay is a stout, middle-aged man with a weathered face that tells stories of years spent in the harsh desert environment. His dark hair is streaked with gray, and his warm brown eyes have a way of making strangers feel welcome while missing nothing that goes on in his establishment. He wears practical clothing - a simple tunic and leather apron - and moves with the efficiency of someone who has spent decades managing a busy inn. His hands are calloused from years of hard work, and he has a distinctive limp from an old injury that he refuses to discuss. His voice is deep and friendly, with a natural storyteller's cadence that draws people in.

## Personality:

Tobay is gregarious, observant, and deeply protective of his establishment and its patrons. He has a natural talent for reading people and knowing when to offer a listening ear or when to step in to prevent trouble. He's fiercely loyal to Alexandria and its people, having lived through some of the town's darkest times. Despite his friendly exterior, he's no fool - he's learned to be cautious of outsiders while still maintaining the hospitality that keeps his inn thriving. He has a dry sense of humor and enjoys sharing stories with trusted regulars, though he's careful about what information he shares.

## History:

Tobay was born in Alexandria and has spent his entire life in the town. He inherited the Sentinel's Rest from his father, who built the establishment during a period of relative peace. Tobay learned the business from the ground up, working every job in the inn before taking over. He's seen Alexandria through good times and bad, including the great sandstorm of 1478 DR, when his inn served as emergency shelter for many townspeople. His limp comes from an injury sustained during a bandit raid several years ago, when he helped defend the town alongside the guards. This experience earned him the respect of the town's defenders and cemented his reputation as a reliable ally.

## Motivation:

Tobay is driven by a desire to maintain the Sentinel's Rest as a safe haven for travelers and a gathering place for Alexandria's community. He sees his inn as more than just a business - it's a vital part of the town's social fabric and a place where people can find shelter, information, and companionship. He's particularly motivated to help the town's defenders and to ensure that visitors understand and respect Alexandria's unique culture and challenges.
