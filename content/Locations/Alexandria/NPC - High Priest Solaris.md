## Description:

High Priest Solaris is a tall, imposing figure in his early fifties with silver-streaked black hair and piercing golden eyes that seem to reflect the desert sun. His weathered face bears the marks of years spent in the harsh desert climate, but his bearing is regal and commanding. He wears flowing white robes adorned with golden sun symbols and carries a staff topped with a crystal that catches and reflects sunlight. His voice is deep and resonant, carrying the authority of both religious leader and community protector.

## Personality:

Solaris is wise, charismatic, and deeply committed to both his faith and the protection of Alexandria. He balances spiritual guidance with practical leadership, understanding that in a town constantly threatened by desert dangers, faith must be backed by strength. He's patient with those seeking guidance but firm when dealing with threats to the community. His sermons often focus on resilience, survival, and the light that guides through darkness. He has a particular concern for the town's children and elderly, seeing their protection as sacred duty.

## History:

Solaris was born in Alexandria and raised in the temple, showing early aptitude for both healing and leadership. He spent his youth studying under the previous High Priest, learning the ancient ways of the Sun God and the practical skills needed to survive in the desert. During the great sandstorm of 1478 DR, he was instrumental in organizing the temple's emergency shelter and healing efforts, earning the respect of the entire community. He became High Priest ten years ago and has since worked tirelessly to strengthen both the spiritual and physical defenses of Alexandria.

## Motivation:

Solaris is driven by a deep commitment to protect Alexandria and guide its people through both spiritual and physical challenges. He believes that faith and practical action must work together, and he sees the temple as both a place of worship and a stronghold of community defense. He's particularly focused on preparing Alexandria for future threats and ensuring the younger generation understands both their spiritual heritage and survival skills.
