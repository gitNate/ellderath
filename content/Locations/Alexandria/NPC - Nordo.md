## Description:

Nordo is a stout dwarf in his early fifties with a thick, well-groomed beard that he often braids with small metal beads. His dark eyes are sharp and calculating, missing no detail in his store or the people who enter it. He wears practical but well-made clothing - a sturdy tunic and leather vest - and moves with the efficiency of someone who has spent decades organizing and managing inventory. His hands are strong and skilled, equally adept at handling delicate goods or heavy equipment. He speaks in a deep, measured voice with a slight accent that hints at his origins in the mountain regions.

## Personality:

Nordo is pragmatic, detail-oriented, and fiercely protective of his business and his customers. He has a natural talent for organization and logistics, keeping his store running like a well-oiled machine. He's cautious but fair in his dealings, understanding that in Alexandria's harsh environment, trust and reliability are as valuable as gold. He's particularly protective of the town's supply lines and takes pride in ensuring that Alexandria has access to the goods it needs to survive. Despite his businesslike exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and enjoys sharing stories with trusted customers, though he's careful about what information he shares.

Nordo was born in the mountain regions but left his homeland in search of new opportunities.

Over the years, he has built a reputation for fair dealing and quality merchandise, earning the trust of both locals and travelers.
