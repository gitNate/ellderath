## Description:

Sergeant Mira Sandstrider is a lean, athletic woman in her early thirties with sun-bronzed skin and sharp green eyes that seem to miss nothing. Her dark hair is kept in practical braids, and her movements are quick and silent, reflecting years of training as a scout. She wears lightweight leather armor designed for mobility and carries a composite bow and a curved scimitar. Her face is marked by a thin scar across her left cheek, a reminder of a close encounter with desert bandits. She speaks in a quiet, measured tone, choosing her words carefully and **always listening more than she talks**.

## Personality:

Mira is observant, patient, and methodical - essential qualities for a scout operating in the dangerous desert environment. She's naturally cautious and prefers to gather information before acting, but she's also decisive when action is required. She has a deep respect for the desert and its dangers, and she's protective of her fellow scouts and the town. Despite her serious nature, she has a dry wit and enjoys sharing stories with trusted comrades. She's particularly protective of new recruits, understanding how dangerous the desert can be for the inexperienced.
