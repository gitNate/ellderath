# History

Alexandria was founded by survivors of a great sandstorm that destroyed several smaller settlements in the region. The town's founders chose this location for its natural defenses and access to fresh water from underground springs. Over the decades, Alexandria has grown into a prosperous trading hub, though it has never forgotten its origins as a refuge from the desert's wrath.

The town's most infamous moment came during the great sandstorm of 1478 DR, when then-Mayor Aldric abandoned a squad of guards led by [[Scorch]] to the [[Illgadar Desert]] rather than risk opening the gates during the storm. This decision created the notorious bandit leader and left a lasting stain on Alexandria's leadership.
