# Overview

Alexandria, nestled on the southeastern coast of a rugged peninsula, is a town shaped by the harsh realities of its surroundings. Bordered by the unforgiving [[Illgadar Desert]] to the west and the treacherous [[The Giants Maw]] to the South and East, Alexandria's culture has evolved to be resilient, cautious, and fiercely protective. The frequent threats from bandits, harsh desert conditions, and lurking dangers have made Alexandrians wary of outsiders, fostering a community that values strength, vigilance, and self-reliance.

# History

Alexandria was founded by survivors of a great sandstorm that destroyed several smaller settlements in the region. The town's founders chose this location for its natural defenses and access to fresh water from underground springs. Over the decades, Alexandria has grown into a prosperous trading hub, though it has never forgotten its origins as a refuge from the desert's wrath.
