## Description:

A well-groomed tiefling with deep purple skin and silver eyes. His horns are long and elegantly curved, and he carries himself with the confidence of a trained mage. He wears the traditional robes of a Mages Guild apprentice, modified with subtle personal touches.

## Personality:

Diligent and methodical, Lucan approaches every situation with careful consideration. He's friendly and approachable, making him an excellent representative for the Mages Guild. His loyalty to the guild is unwavering, and he takes his responsibilities seriously.

## History:

Born to a family of tieflings with a long history of magical talent, Lucan was accepted into the Mages Guild at a young age. His natural aptitude for understanding magical theory and his diplomatic skills made him a perfect choice for this mission.

## Motivation:

To prove his worth to the Mages Guild and advance his magical studies by successfully completing this mission.

## Unique Ability:

**Arcane Resonance**: Lucan has developed a special connection with magical artifacts. When within 30 feet of a magical item, he can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to sense its general purpose and power level. This ability helps him identify which artifacts are worth recovering and which might be too dangerous to handle.
