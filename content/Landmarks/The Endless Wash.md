[[Ellderath]] #Ocean #Landmark #ðŸ’§

# Overview

The vast western ocean that marks the edge of known Ellderath. The Endless Wash is known for its treacherous waters, unpredictable weather, and the mysterious fate of those who venture too far west. The coastal waters are heavily fished and traded, while the deeper waters remain largely unexplored.

# Description

The Endless Wash is characterized by its deep blue waters, strong currents, and frequent storms. The coastal waters are relatively calm and well-mapped, while the deeper waters become increasingly dangerous and mysterious. The ocean floor drops off sharply about 50 miles from shore, creating a deep trench that has never been fully explored.

The ocean is divided into three main regions:

- **The Coastal Waters**: Well-traveled and relatively safe

- **The Expanse**: Mysterious and largely unexplored
