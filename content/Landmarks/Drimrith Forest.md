[[Ellderath]] #Landmark #Forest #ðŸŒ²

# Overview

A vast temperate forest. The forest is known for its dense canopy, ancient trees, and the network of game trails that have been used by hunters and travelers for generations.

# Description

The Drimrith Forest is characterized by its towering oak and pine trees, some reaching over 100 feet in height. The forest floor is covered in a thick layer of moss and fallen leaves, creating a natural carpet that muffles sound. Several small streams and creeks wind their way through the forest, eventually feeding into Lake Ent to the east.

The forest is divided into three distinct regions:

- **Northern Edge**: Denser, older growth with massive trees. Home to the most dangerous wildlife.
- **Central Region**: A mix of old and new growth, crisscrossed by well-maintained game trails. Near [[Creekside]]
- **Southern Border**: Thinner forest that gradually gives way to the mountains near [[Vinrick]].
