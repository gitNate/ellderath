# Key Features of the Knifepoint Peaks

## **Fabled Green Dragon:** Legends speak of a powerful green dragon that once roamed the Knifepoint Peaks, its scales blending with the lush foliage of the mountains. The dragon has not been seen for centuries, but its legend persists, a tale of terror and majesty passed down through generations. Some say the dragon still sleeps within a hidden cave, guarding a treasure hoard beyond imagination. #DragonDust #MetallicDragonEye

## **The Dragon's Hoard:** Tales of immense wealth hidden within the dragon's lair attract adventurers from far and wide. Some claim to have found clues leading to the dragon's resting place, but none have returned to confirm their discoveries.

## **Giant's Playground:** While the dragon is unknown the Knifepoint Peaks are a #Giant Playground with various Hill and Stone Giants roaming about. Some say deep under the mountains there are Fire Giants. #GiantHeartsBlood

## **Abandoned Ghost Town:** Nestled within a secluded valley lies an eerie ghost town, its name lost to time. Once a bustling mining settlement, it now stands as a silent monument to the past, with crumbling buildings and rusted mining equipment. Stories of supernatural occurrences and restless spirits keep most adventurers at bay, but the truly brave (or foolish) might venture in search of forgotten riches or ancient secrets.

## **Vegetation:** The lower slopes of the Knifepoint Peaks are covered in dense forests of pine and fir, giving way to hardy shrubs and alpine flowers at higher altitudes. Rare herbs and medicinal plants grow in secluded spots, sought after by herbalists and alchemists.

## **Haunted Mines:** The abandoned ghost town's mines are said to be haunted by the spirits of miners who perished in a catastrophic collapse. Strange noises, flickering lights, and ghostly apparitions deter all but the most determined explorers.

# Dwarven Mines (Player Info)

- **Overview**: Old dwarven delves riddle the western faces of the Peaks. Stonework terraces, ruined hoists, and rune-banded doors mark former entrances; many outer works are visible from the valleys on clear days.
- **Access**: Main gates are collapsed in places. Careful explorers can find narrow intake shafts and maintenance crawls that lead inside. Ropes and a cool head are recommended.
- **What You Might Find**: Abandoned tools, sealed crates of steel ingots, traces of mithral filaments in pillar rock, and masterwork implements prized in [[Celladane]]. Wyrmglass crystals faintly resonate near magic and are valuable to alchemists.
- **Friendly Contact**: [[NPC - Grim Ironbeard]] in [[Celladane]] is known to share advice, maps, or gear for safe delving—at a fair price.
