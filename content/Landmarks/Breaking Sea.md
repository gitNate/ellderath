# Overview

The Breaking Sea is a treacherous expanse of water known for its sudden and violent storms. Ancient mariners speak of massive creatures lurking in its depths, and many ships have vanished without a trace. The sea gets its name from the way storms seem to "break" upon its surface, creating waves that can swallow entire vessels.
