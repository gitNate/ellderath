[[Ellderath]] #Landmark #Crater #⛰️

# Overview

A massive impact crater that has become a unique ecosystem in the region. The crater's steep walls and unusual terrain make it a natural barrier, while its mineral-rich soil and unique features have attracted both scientific interest and opportunistic fools.

# Description

The Fellstar Crater is approximately 5 miles in diameter, with walls rising up to 1,000 feet in some places. The crater floor is relatively flat, with a central depression that fills with water during the rainy season. The walls are composed of exposed rock layers, revealing the region's geological history.

The crater is divided into three main regions:

- **The Rim**: Steep, rocky walls with sparse vegetation
- **The Slope**: A gradual descent with unique plant life
- **The Basin**: The crater floor, home to a seasonal lake
