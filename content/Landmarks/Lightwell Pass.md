Natural Hazards

1. Avalanches: Sudden and deadly, avalanches can be triggered by loud noises or natural shifts in the snow. Travelers must be cautious and always watch for signs of unstable snow.
2. Rockslides: The steep cliffs and loose rocks make rockslides a constant threat. These can occur without warning, burying the path and anyone on it.
3. Treacherous Weather: The weather in the pass is highly unpredictable. Sudden snowstorms, blizzards, and freezing temperatures can catch travelers off guard, leading to hypothermia or worse.
4. Narrow and Crumbling Paths: The narrow paths are often crumbling and unstable. A misstep can send a traveler plummeting down a steep cliffside.
5. Dense Fog: Dense fog often blankets the pass, reducing visibility to mere feet. This makes navigation extremely difficult and increases the risk of getting lost or stepping off the path.

Creatures and Beasts

3. Snow Wolves: Packs of these fierce predators roam the pass, hunting for anything that moves. They are highly territorial and will attack if they feel threatened.
4. Harpies: These vile creatures nest in the cliffs and swoop down on unsuspecting travelers. Their enchanting songs can lure individuals off the path and into deadly traps.
5. Frost Giants: Rare but incredibly dangerous, frost giants sometimes wander down from their higher altitudes. They are immensely strong and hostile to intruders.

Bandits and Outlaws

1. The Frost Fang Clan: A notorious group of bandits that preys on travelers. They are well-equipped and know the pass intimately, using its natural hazards to their advantage.

Mystical and Supernatural Threats

2. Cursed Ruins: The ruins scattered throughout the pass are believed to be cursed. Those who linger too long in these places often report hearing whispers and feeling an overwhelming sense of dread.
3. Wandering Wraiths: Restless spirits of those who died in the pass, these wraiths are tormented and aggressive. They attack living beings, seeking to drag them into the afterlife.

Tips for Survival

2. Be Prepared: Carry sufficient supplies, including warm clothing, food, and magical items for protection.
