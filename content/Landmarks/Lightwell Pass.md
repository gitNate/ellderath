Natural Hazards

- Sudden and deadly, avalanches can be triggered by loud noises or natural shifts in the snow. Travelers must be cautious and always watch for signs of unstable snow.
- Narrow and Crumbling Paths: The narrow paths are often crumbling and unstable. A misstep can send a traveler plummeting down a steep cliffside.
- Dense Fog: Dense fog often blankets the pass, reducing visibility to mere feet. This makes navigation extremely difficult and increases the risk of getting lost or stepping off the path.
- Local legends speak of an ancient spirit that haunts the pass. It is said to appear as a ghostly figure in the fog, leading travelers to their doom.
