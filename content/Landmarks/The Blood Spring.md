# Overview

The Blood Spring is a mystical area within the [[Green Shallows Swamp]] where the natural order of life and death seems to be inverted. The water here runs red, and the foliage shifts from deep greens to blood reds, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. The spring is both feared and revered by locals, who believe it holds powerful magical properties.

# Description

A circular pool of crimson water, approximately 50 feet in diameter, surrounded by twisted trees with blood-red leaves. The water's surface constantly ripples, as if alive, and emits a faint, pulsing (Heartbeat) glow. The air is thick with the scent of copper and ozone, and the temperature rises noticeably within 100 feet of the spring. Strange, bioluminescent fungi grow in patterns around the spring's edge, their glow intensifying at night.
