# Overview

The Giants Maw is a vast body of water, surrounded on three sides by land. To the north lies [[Alexandria]] and [[Frindar]], perched on its rugged peninsula, while [[Wintercrest]] sits to the south on its mountain ridge. The waters here are deceptily calm but deep running currents and icebergs make the water treacherous. The surface is often covered in a thick fog that rolls in from the open sea, creating an eerie atmosphere that has given rise to many local legends.

# Factions

- Local fishermen from [[Alexandria]] and [[Wintercrest]] maintain a careful watch
- The [[Black Sun Marauders]] occasionally use the Maw for their operations
