# Overview

The Giants Maw is a vast, crescent-shaped body of water, surrounded on three sides by land. To the north lies [[Alexandria]], perched on its rugged peninsula, while [[Wintercrest]] sits to the south on its mountain ridge. The coastline forms a natural concave shape, creating what appears to be a massive "mouth" when viewed from above. The waters here are deep and treacherous, with strong currents that flow in unpredictable patterns, making navigation challenging even for experienced sailors.

# Description

The Giants Maw spans approximately 50 miles from north to south and 30 miles at its widest point. The water is unnaturally deep, with depths reaching over 1,000 feet in some areas. The surface is often covered in a thick fog that rolls in from the open sea, creating an eerie atmosphere that has given rise to many local legends.

The coastline is marked by dramatic cliffs and rocky outcroppings, particularly near Alexandria, while the southern shores near Wintercrest feature steep, snow-capped mountains that plunge directly into the sea. The water itself is a deep, dark blue that appears almost black in certain lights, contrasting sharply with the turquoise waters of the open ocean beyond.
