# Backstory

Clark Stanley was raised by his father in the cult of the [[Whispering Circle]]. It was part of his father's duties to recruit new members and sacrifices for the cult. They would go from town to town preaching and working small miracles -oftentimes by solving problems they themselves created- and winning over as many people as they could. It was often Clark's job to discreetly create these problems for his father to solve, or fake an injury so he could be "healed". He was never interested in the dark rituals or prayers performed by this ancient sect.
What did interest him, however, were the tithes and donations offered up by the grateful villagers to the cult before they were willingly hauled off for dark rituals. He decided he wanted out so he could make some money of his own. But one does not simply leave the [[Whispering Circle]], so he bided his time. His chance came during what was supposed to be a routine trip to a small village. While his father and other cult members were in the town square preaching to the townsfolk he had snuck away to poison some of the livestock. But these villagers were more leery and had sent for the guards from their local fiefdom. Clark ran off, free at last, while his father and fellow cult members were carted away to be hanged. When he got older, he stuck to what he knew best, creating a fake god for himself and traveling from town to town swindling people out of their hard earned money for "miracles" and "holy" water.

# What Clark Knows

## Clark Stanley's Knowledge of Ellderath

As a former member of the [[Whispering Circle]] who traveled extensively with his father on recruitment and sacrifice missions, Clark Stanley would have gained significant knowledge about the world of [[Ellderath]]:

### **Geographical Knowledge**

- **Coastal Regions**: Having traveled from town to town, Clark would be familiar with the major coastal settlements like [[Alexandria]], [[Bayside]], [[Portside]], and [[Springdoor]]
- **Inland Towns**: He'd know the locations and basic layouts of inland settlements such as [[Bellstone]], [[Blueleaf]], [[Celladane]], and [[Summerset]]
- **Travel Routes**: Clark would understand the major roads and trade routes between settlements, having used them for his father's "miracle" tours

### **Cultural & Social Understanding**

- **Economic Systems**: Clark would understand how different settlements generate wealth (fishing, trade, mining, etc.) and where people are most likely to have disposable income for "donations"

### **Faction Awareness**

- **Whispering Circle Operations**: Clark would know about the cult's main temple in [[Ruindrice]] and their recruitment center in [[Alexandria]]
- **Other Organizations**: Through his father's work, he might have learned about other factions like the [[Mages Guild]], [[Guild of Shadows]], or [[Black Sun Marauders]] that the cult sought to infiltrate

### **Practical Knowledge**

- **Survival Skills**: Years of travel would have taught him about local weather patterns, safe camping spots, and how to navigate between settlements
- **Local Customs**: Clark would know how to blend into different communities, understanding local dialects, customs, and what makes people trust strangers
- **Escape Routes**: Having fled from his father's capture, he'd know multiple ways to leave settlements quickly and where to hide if pursued

### **Limitations of His Knowledge**

- **Deep Lore**: Clark was never interested in the cult's dark rituals or ancient knowledge, so he wouldn't know about the Whispering God's true nature or the cult's deeper magical practices
- **Recent Changes**: Since leaving the cult, he may not be aware of current faction activities or recent developments in settlements
- **Hidden Locations**: While he knows the main settlements, he wouldn't have knowledge of secret cult locations, hidden temples, or underground networks

Clark's knowledge makes him particularly dangerous as a con artist - he knows exactly how to exploit the trust and generosity of [[Ellderath]]'s communities, having learned these manipulation techniques from his father's successful recruitment campaigns.
