# Telgamil

## Backstory

I, Telgamil was born beneath the wide, open sky of Brightfield Vale, a stretch of farmland just outside of [[Bellstone]] nestled between rolling hills in the [[Melzick Plains]]. My parents, Jorvan and Marla, were simple folk — honest, hardworking, and deeply faithful. They never treated my radiant eyes or faint silver glow as anything more than "a sign that the gods keep an eye on you, boy." They taught me to plow straight furrows, tend livestock, and thank the gods for both the sun and the rain.

When you're from the south, life was simple — until the drought came.

The river ran low, crops withered, and hungry mouths grew desperate. My parents prayed nightly at the village shrine, but every day the sky remained empty and hot. It was then that the raiders came — hard-faced men who saw weakness and sought to claim our meager stores.

I remember the moment it happened.

The raiders pushed into our fields, and I stood between them and my family, my father's old pitchfork shaking in my hands. They laughed. Then… the light came. Not from the sky, but from me. A burning warmth spread through my chest, and a voice like ringing bells whispered, "Stand." I didn't win that fight alone — our neighbors rallied, and together we drove them off — but that night I knew my life had changed.

A traveling knight named Ser Aldric, who served the Order of the Shining Crown, saw what had happened and took me under his wing. He spoke of the Oath of Devotion — of honesty, courage, compassion, and faith. I trained with him while still tending the farm, until the day came when my parents blessed me to leave and serve the gods more widely.

Now, I walk the road as both protector and sower — of peace, of hope, and of the Light's truth. My boots carry the dust of far-off towns, but I keep a small pouch of [[Bellstone]] soil at my belt, a reminder that my roots run deep. I still dream of rain falling on my home's fields, and I swear I will return there, my oath fulfilled, to ensure no one in Brightfield Vale ever knows hunger or fear again.
