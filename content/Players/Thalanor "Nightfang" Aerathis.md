# Backstory

Born within a secretive enclave of Fire Giants in the far southern kingdom of [[Celladane]], Thalanor's birth was marked as an omen. His flame, unlike the deep red of his kin, burned a vivid, icy blue. Some whispered it was a divine blessing; others, a curse that would bring ruin.

As he grew, his towering strength was matched only by his restless spirit. That restlessness carried him beyond the safety of his enclave—where fate struck swiftly. Ambushed by slavers, Thalanor was sold to the [[Eyeless]]. There, his brute force was forged into something far deadlier. Under the cold, tutelage of [[NPC - Death's Hand]], Thalanor learned to move unseen, strike with precision, and leave nothing but silence in his wake.

Then came the mission in the frozen reaches of [[Wintercrest]]—a turning point he would never forget. Ravion's orders had been clear: eliminate the target, take the eyes. Thalanor On the return journey, betrayal waited in the snow.

Ravion intercepted Thalanor on a narrow mountain pass and they embraced. As they drew apart, only then did Thalanor noticed Ravion's blade driven into his side. Confusion and betrayal written on his face, Ravion responded, "Don't you see Thalanor? The innocent are only innocent because no one's accused them yet. Why did you have to question me?"
The last thing Thalanor saw before the world turned white was Ravion's cold gaze as he was hurled from the cliff into the abyss below.

Broken, bleeding, and half-buried in the drifts, Thalanor's vision dimmed. Rage and pain warred within him, but one vow burned through the haze: If I live, Ravion Duskbane will die by my hand.

Then, through the roaring blizzard, a shape emerged—a massive spectral snow leopard. Its coat shimmered with frost, and its eyes burned with the same blue fire that burned within Thalanor. The creature spoke, its voice a deep, resonant echo that seemed to shake the very air:

"Never harm the innocent, Nightfang. But for the guilty… let your justice fall swift and unyielding, as cold and sharp as obsidian."

## Signature Kill

When Thalanor delivers the killing blow with his psionic blade, the victim's soul is seared and severed from reality. Their eyes turn to perfect black obsidian, their final moment forever trapped in the stone. This is the mark of The Obsidian Leopard, feared in both the underworld and the highest courts of power.
