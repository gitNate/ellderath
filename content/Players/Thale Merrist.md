# Backstory

Thale Merrist's earliest memories are of hunger and running—darting between alleyways in [[Pertance]]'s merchant quarter, living off stolen bread and trinkets. At fourteen, he was caught lifting a jeweled snuffbox from a [[Mages Guild]] physician. Instead of handing him to the constables, the mage—[[Master Mephistra Shadowweave - Illusionist]]—offered him a bargain: apprenticeship in exchange for honest work and study. Thale accepted, discovering a rare talent for illusion magic. Under [[Master Mephistra Shadowweave - Illusionist]]'s mentorship, he also learned the art of medicine, binding wounds and treating the sick with both poultices and herbs. Over the years, he took the Healer's Code, swearing to use his magic in service of life rather than deceit—though the cunning instincts of his street years have never truly left him.

## Appearance

Lithe and lanky, he moves with wiry precision. His thick, wavy hair perpetually defies combs, and his light tan skin contrasts with the piercing green of his eyes. His wardrobe mirrors the gentlemanly style of learned mages and physicians: tailored coats, fine waistcoats, and immaculate gloves.

## Personality

Self-conscious yet deeply informative, humor rarely passes his lips, though his attentiveness and cooperative manner earn respect among peers. Still, in moments of crisis, the survival instincts of his youth resurface—when resources are scarce, he chooses himself first (weakness).
