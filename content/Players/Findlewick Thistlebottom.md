## Backstory

Findlewick Thistlebottom had his life all figured out. Born in the mossy glades outside the great city, he showed just enough magical aptitude in his youth to be accepted into the [[Mages Guild]] — but not so much that anyone expected greatness from him. Perfect. Instead of chasing glory, Findlewick secured a cushy post as the guild's librarian, where he could spend decades "maintaining the archives" (which mostly meant reading interesting books and napping in the sunny alcove near the east window).

Over the years, he developed an almost artistic mastery of avoiding actual work. Need a heavy tome from the top shelf? Mage Hand. Need to cross the library? Tenser's Floating Disk. Need someone to deal with a noisy patron? That's what apprentices are for. His dream was simple: survive the next few decades surrounded by dusty tomes, teapots, and zero peril until a quiet retirement in the gnome-lands.

Unfortunately, life had other plans. Somewhere between "Archmage Dorsival's Treatise on Wards" and his afternoon nap, Findlewick found himself "volunteered" by [[Master Oshka MindPiercer - Abjuration]] for an expedition — the kind involving danger, travel, and absolutely no comfortable chairs. No one was more annoyed than he was. Grumbling to himself while climbing onto his disk, "If they think I'm walking one blasted step of this journey, they've got another thing coming…"

## Desired Possessions

He wishes he had:

- **Bag of Holding**: For carrying his extensive collection of books and tea supplies
- **Ring of Spell Storing**: To store utility spells for maximum comfort
- **Arcane Grimoire**: To enhance his magical knowledge and abilities
- **Staff of the Magi**: For protection and enhanced spellcasting

## Summary

Findlewick's knowledge is primarily focused on academic magic, library sciences, and the comfortable life of a guild librarian. His extensive reading and access to the Mages Guild archives have given him broad theoretical knowledge of magic and scholarly pursuits, while his practical experience is limited to urban comfort and magical convenience. While he has deep understanding of magical theory and guild operations, his worldview is largely confined to the safe, scholarly environment of the Tower of Pertance, and he actively avoids situations that might require physical exertion or personal risk.
